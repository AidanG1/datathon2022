## Objectives 🧠

Breezee seeks to establish predictions for 72 hours into the future regarding "any way the wind blows," and how fast. We leverage the National Data Buoy Center's network of sensors to obtain data from the past 45 days, then display it in our dashboard alongside the future prediction model trained using the historical data.

## Modeling 🏋️

Long Short Term Memory performed best.

## Techstack 💻

-Deta Hosting for Dashboard
-Amazon Web Services Image for Model Training and Predictions
-JupyterNotebooks for Data Exploration and Cleaning Methodology
